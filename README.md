Toters is a reliable on-demand delivery tech
platform that allows customers to deliver anything
from anywhere right to their doorstep. From
logistics to technology, design, and support
DNA students have been assigned to implement
simulations of this application by Dart and
Flutter, and I am one of those students and
this is my application.
